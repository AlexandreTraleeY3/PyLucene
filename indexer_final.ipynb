      "Comment body: Seems some homework was done on how to build addictive entertainment. Every week I’m surprised at the age group range I see at raid hour in town, everything from 6 to 85 in wheelchairs and all forms in between. Have seen as many as around 200 people on community day flooding the sidewalks and nearly getting ran over.... never said they were all smart and mindful. But I can’t quite give it 5stars :/ Some things I could complain about, are actually what aids in keeping you playing, so I won’t on those things.. However, Shadow Pokémon are a more real issue.. They look cool, but you have to give up the looks to make them useful and that stinks! Collectors are getting gouged on them as you need to significantly increase your room to store them, at some $$ or large amounts of time. They don’t have an entry in the Pokédex so you either have to keep them to see again, destroy them by purification or transferring them into nothingness.... Is there really no room in your worlds design for the classic shadow/evil/underworld style classifications that been the main stay of gaming for decades?? Let us make them usable via TM’s and just drop the skill reset on purification, or work harder and give them a new move set category with maybe a smaller skill set pool if it makes it easier.. and the way your trading system destroys IV’s on trade I don’t even see any harm in letting us trade them....\n",

First, I would like some type of free roll tournament every week or month where people could enter for free and maybe earn some bit of real money.  Second, I think it would also be nice if there was just a little bit more time to make a decision with hands unless I have missed something.  Finally, it would be cool to have leagues of some sort both public and private where people could play like a season or something along those lines. Now to hit on a point that a lot of people bring up in their reviews about having to pay money.  Depends on how good you are in all honesty and how well you understand poker and how the people who make games make money.  If you aren’t good and you want the games bracelets/rings you are either going to have to be good and earn them the real way or pay lots of money.  Poker is a game where 80% or more of people that play never turn a profit it would be stupid not to capitalize on this as a developer and they also have to make money to give us a great game.  Like I said truly a great game just a lot of people not understanding how things work in their reviews.']\n"

Have seen as many as around 200 people on community day flooding the sidewalks and nearly getting ran over.... never said they were all smart and mindful. But I can’t quite give it 5stars :/ Some things I could complain about, are actually what aids in keeping you playing, so I won’t on those things.. However, Shadow Pokémon are a more real issue.. They look cool, but you have to give up the looks to make them useful and that stinks! Collectors are getting gouged on them as you need to significantly increase your room to store them, at some $$ or large amounts of time. They don’t have an entry in the Pokédex so you either have to keep them to see again, destroy them by purification or transferring them into nothingness.... Is there really no room in your worlds design for the classic shadow/evil/underworld style classifications that been the main stay of gaming for decades?? Let us make them usable via TM’s and just drop the skill reset on purification, or work harder and give them a new move set category with maybe a smaller skill set pool if it makes it easier.. and the way your trading system destroys IV’s on trade I don’t even see any harm in letting us trade them....>>\n",

But first of all, in the video previewing the game it shows them putting James Harden, a SG, in the SF player slot. But how come I can’t put players out of position in the real game? The training also looks different in the video. I think putting players out of position would be awesome, and it just doesn’t count for chemistry. Anyway, my first suggestion is to allow you to sub your bench players in in-game. Also allow for instant replays and at the end of season games/h2h quarters let you see the players’ stats. Also, for the programs, stay more consistent with players’ overalls. For example, the legends started as 89s and to do the set you had to get 4 worse legend cards for that player. Well now, the legends are 96s and the best player in their sets are 90s. They’re better than the original legends that got released. The way I explained that is a bit confusing but those who play know what I mean. Also the superstars started as 93s and costed 120 superstar tokens. Now IT4 is a 95 superstar and costs 100 superstar tokens. Logical? No. Those are the glaring problems imo other than the pay to win which is annoying and doesn’t need to be explained. The small problems are just things like making more gameplay graphics and little bug fixes. I hope you read this EA and make these things happen.\n",

      "I have been playing this game for approx. 10 months.  This is the most watched over game by it’s inventors that I have ever seen.  Besides being highly addictive(I have spent hundreds of dollars on this game) you get “cheated” with hands that rarely should come up(4 of kind, straight flush) to beat your Full House and the game sends you a message saying “Bad Beat”.  BS !!!  Don’t believe Superstars comments that say they follow all rules for random fair play.  That is an outright lie.   They also have a wireless symbol that comes up and totally halts the game when you have a great hand.  When you enter individual Tournaments, the wheel that spins to decide how much you will play for rarely goes over double your investment when the wheel has at least 10 other denominations of much higher value.   The average good rating(4.6) that this game shows is totally bogus.  I guarantee you.  Which means the owner is tampering with the reviews.  To top it off, I was entered in a tournament and the game froze as I consulted with the other players to verify.  I lost the 2.5m chips I entered with and Superstars would not send those back after 3 emails with them.  TERRIBLE GAME GO TO ANOTHER !!!\n",

      "I have spent so many hundreds of dollars on this game in the last month of playing. When they tell you that you will get money after the event is over, is all a lie. There was only five minutes left, I left the app and came back 10 minutes later, and there was nothing. And I had made over $50 in purchases just that day!!!!! And then when it’s time for a bonus on a certain game called “YEAR OF THE PIG” - it reset on me!!! I was playing 3 BILLION A HAND! Because I knew it was almost time. This is not fair, I have spent hundreds and hundreds, and I had billions.Worst part is, you contact support and they say they’re on “holiday”. Not my problem - that your “holiday” lasts weeks. I’ve been waiting for an answer since mid April! I will be reporting them, because they don’t deserve to have an app in the App Store.\n",
